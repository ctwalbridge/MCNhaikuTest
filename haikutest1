Basho's Old Pond, translated
old pond
frog leaps in
water's sound 

another by Basho
the first cold shower
even the monkey seems to want
a little coat of straw 

from Basho's page on Wikipedia
Since the crescent moon, I have been waiting for tonight
and that's the translation of the haiku in the image Poet-Basho-and-Moon_Festival-Tsukioka-Yoshitoshi-1891
